# StitchPatternFormatter

This project is currently in progress. 

The goal of this project is to create an interactive program where users can enter in the text instructions of a pattern and receive a visual
representation of the pattern, with the symbols that they choose. Users will also be able to choose to have a stitch marker in the visual 
representation, which they can move through the pattern. 

Currently, this project is only runnable through the command line. The end goal is to turn this into a website and mobile app. 

### Current State
There is no main function yet. Everything has been verified through unit tests. 
Most of the basic backend features are finished. 

Remaining backend work before main function can be worked on: 
Connecting the multiplier to the pattern formatter
Identify a loop
Prevent usage of constants as stitch names
